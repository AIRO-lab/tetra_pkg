 * @brief sick_scan2 test_server_lidar_msg implements the ldmrs specific messages,
 * i.e. message receiving and message creation to simulate ldmrs devices.
 *
 * Note: sick_scan2 test_server_lidar_msg does not implement the functions of lidar sensors,
 * it just implements a simple message handling to test the sick_scan2 ros drivers.
